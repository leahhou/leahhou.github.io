# Purpose of the application

### People usually set goals at the beginning of the year as their new year resolutions. Yet the majority have failed to achieve them.
### There are multiple reasons of failure, such as:

* Setting unrealistic goals and they cannot meet their expectations
* Setting too many goals all at once
* Time management to action on them
* Lack of motivation to reach their goals
* Lack of support to reach their goals

### To resolve the issue outlined above, we would like to create the Goalnut application to provide solutions. Goalnuts can help the intended users to :
* Set multiple goals, actions and track your progress on each goal
* Analyze their actions, progress and goals
* Analyze if they set their goal too high and they constantly cannot meet the goal.
* Analyze if they allocate reasonable amount of time to achieving multiple goals
* Encourage their progress 
* Feel supported and get tips by get connected  to other Goalnut members who have similar goals

# Intended users of applications
### Inclusive to all members in general public. 
### User friendly interface allows visually impaired and illiterate users to use the application.

     
# Possible impact of the application
## A. Possible positive social impact
* The application is created to help people feel positive about their accomplishment when achieving the goal
* Equip members with useful tools to achieve their goals
* Building a community to help eachother to achieve their goals

## B. Possible misuse of Goalnut
* The sense of community should be carefully designed for encouragement and support, and should not be used to increase unnecesarry competition.
* Goalnut used should be correctly encouraged, rather than being criticized if they haven't achieve their goals
* The potential for this application to be used by people who have goals that could negatively impact themselves and society in general could be cause for worry. An example of this could be the use of the application to keep track of an eating disorder.


# Major feature of the application (MVP)
##### (Given the constraint of time to the project (2 days), we focuses on building four major features of Goalnut)
#### Feature One: Goal Setting
### The application allows users to set ONE goal. For example, a goal could be to "exercise more this year".

#### Feature Two: Action Setting
### The application allows users to set : 
* One action they would like to do to achieve their goal, such as "jogging".
* Set the expected frequency of the action, such as "3 times a week" 
* Set the expected duration of the action, such as "30 mins jogging" 

#### Feature Three: Action Logging per week
* Log in all activities once a week, recoding times of actions executed, and duration of each action
#### Feature Four: Track Progress and be rewarded per week
* Calculate the percentage the users who have hit their goals. 
* * For example, "80% of time you have run 30 mins this week" 
* Give average of your actions. 
* * For example, "on average, you have run 20 mins this week"
* Give ascci donut artwork as rewards when goals achieved
* Give encouraging words when goals haven’t been achieved

### Rationale for success/failure to meet MVP ‘main’ features:

* Feature one-->Complete : achieved
User input for their goal has been Implemented.


* Feature two-->Complete: achieved
User input for action has been implemented.
User input for expected frequency has been implemented.
User input for expected duration has been implemented.

* Feature Three-->Incomplete:
Saving and loading files has not been implemented due to time constraints, this has led to tracking user input over larger time frames impractical. This feature will have to be pushed to the backlog until saving and loading has been added.

* Feature Four-->Complete: 
Printing of ascii art reward has been implemented.
Outputting encouragement to user that did not achieve their goal has been implemented.
Outputting average and percentage of goal has been implemented.


# Additional features of the application
* Files load/save: the users log out and their previous inputs are saved
* Set multiple goals 
* Set multiple actions to achieve their goals. For example, setting swimming, jogging and gym towards the goal:exercise more
* Set the period they would like to compare their actions
* Be able to keep track for a month, or a quarter or a year
* Reminder functions: sending automatic emails to remind logging in their actions
* Use text to speech to allow visually impaired and illiterate users to use app.
* Application users would be able to connect with each other and share their experience
* Applications users can support each other and share tips in achieving their goals

# Instructions for use
1. Download Goalnut Application to your computer
2. Open Terminal 
3. Open goalnut ruby file
4. Follow the prompts to enter goals, actions and track progress
5. Exit Terminal

## Details of design & planning process

# Initial Brainstorming
Initially, we each wrote two ideas for a terminal application onto a page. After stating our ideas, we went through the potential for each idea and the challenges we would face through their development.


# Ideations for app:
#### IDEA ONE: PET MONITOR APP.

* Track Food consumed.
* Track excersize.
* Calculate Dietry requirements.
* Generate a 'BMI' for the users pet.
* Inform the user if their pet is unhealthy.

#### IDEA TWO: GOAL APP.

* List of goals.
* Aspirations.
* Reviewing goals.
* Offer fun reward for user when successful.
* Offer Encouragement for user when unsuccessful.

#### IDEA THREE: SHOPPING LIST APP.

* Takes user entry.
* Stores the entry into a list.
* Allows the user to modify list.
* - Delete items.
* - Add items.
* - Adjust quantities. 

#### IDEA FOUR: TRANSPORTATION
* Record user data
* Track the total time spent on transport
* Track average daily dollar amount spent on transport.
* Return the total time spent on transport for a period.
* Return the total dollar amount the user spends per period.


# Project Selection: GOAL APP

After brainstorming general ideas, we then gave each idea a ranking of '1 - 4' with '1' being the idea we wished to work on the most.
The idea with the lowest score would be the project we chose to develop further.

## Further planning and devlopment.

After deciding to move forward with the goal application we then took the elements we wished to implement and split them up into features that would be necessary for the minimum viable product( the 'MVP') and features that we considered extras(the 'sprinkles') and not needed for initial deployment.

##### Trello Screenshot:

![alt text](https://github.com/leahhou/Goalnut/blob/master/terminal_app_screens/Trello%202%20.png?raw=true)

#### MVP Features:
* User input
* User Goals
* Level of goals
* Time spent on task/action
* Reward for achieveing goal

#### Sprinkles
* Interactive Menu
* File loading and saving
* Tracking a goal over large time frames
* Ascii art for a reward.
* email reminder for entering goals
* track multiply goals at a time

# Project plan and timeline.

After assigning each feature to either MVP or Sprinkles, we were able to prioritise features and elements for the devlopment process. This can be seen from the organisational structure of our feature and todo trello boards.
By moving features between testing and developing cards, on trello, we were able to bring all elements together in an iterative process that allowed for review and adaption through all stages of the project.

### Communication

Throughout the development process communication was cruicial, especially when dealing with the editing of linked files and elements. Slack was used to make this process easier and streamline communication.

#### Flowchart

* As development progressed and we had to alter our plan, we also updated the flowchart. 
* Below you can find the iterations of the flowchart in order.

#### Commenting

* To keep the code clean and readable we have created blocks of comments above each method relevent to the method and its contents.
* Examples of commenting:

#### Gems:
* Colorize:
* * The desire to make the application more visualy appealing led us to choose this gem. 
* * Link to github page can be found below.

* TTY:
* * Planned addition: To use and replace all input and menus with iteractive selection

#### Testing examples
* For testing we have used 'p' statements to print the raw value of variables and input. Example below:
